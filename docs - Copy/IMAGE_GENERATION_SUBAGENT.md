## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Marketing Asset Generation
```
User: "Create social media assets for our new product launch"
Agent: Generates multiple variations across all providers, optimizes for different platforms, organizes by campaign theme, and delivers ready-to-use assets with metadata.
```

### 2. Development Workflow Integration
```
Developer: Working on website layout needing placeholder images
Agent: Automatically generates contextually appropriate images, optimizes for web delivery, and integrates into development workflow through MCP.
```

### 3. A/B Testing and Comparison
```
Marketing Team: "Test different visual styles for our campaign"
Agent: Generates same concept across all providers, analyzes performance metrics, provides recommendations based on engagement data.
```

### 4. Content Personalization
```
User: "Create images that match our brand guidelines"
Agent: Analyzes brand assets, applies consistent styling across generations, maintains visual identity, and ensures compliance with brand standards.
```

## Autonomous Decision Making

### Provider Selection Logic
1. **Quality Requirements**: High-res needs → OpenAI, Creative editing → Gemini, Open source → Replicate
2. **Cost Optimization**: Budget constraints → Route to most cost-effective option
3. **Performance**: Historical success rates → Prefer high-performing providers
4. **Availability**: Real-time health checks → Avoid overloaded providers

### Quality Assessment Criteria
- **Technical Quality**: Resolution, clarity, artifacts, composition
- **Prompt Adherence**: How well the image matches the request
- **Brand Consistency**: Alignment with established visual standards
- **Content Safety**: Compliance with moderation policies

### Escalation Triggers
- **Critical Failures**: Multiple provider failures, API key issues
- **Quality Issues**: Consistently poor generation quality
- **Performance Degradation**: Significant increases in response time
