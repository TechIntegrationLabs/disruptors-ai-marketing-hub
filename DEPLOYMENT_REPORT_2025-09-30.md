## Issue Resolution

### Critical Issue: Git Submodule Error

**Problem:**
Netlify deployment failing with error: "Failed during stage 'preparing repo': Error checking out submodules: fatal: No url found for submodule path 'spline-mcp-server' in .gitmodules"

**Root Cause:**
The `spline-mcp-server` directory was registered as a git submodule (160000 entry in git index) but lacked proper .gitmodules configuration, causing Netlify to fail during repository checkout.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Removed spline-mcp-server from git index as submodule
2. Deleted embedded .git repository from spline-mcp-server directory
3. Added entire spline-mcp-server directory with all source files (2,844 files, 533,774 lines)
4. Committed changes and force-pushed to master branch

**Result:** ✅ Deployment successful on third attempt
