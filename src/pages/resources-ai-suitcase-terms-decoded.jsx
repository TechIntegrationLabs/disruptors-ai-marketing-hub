          <h2>The Problem with Suitcase Words</h2>
          <p>Some terms, like "agent," are so packed with different meanings they become useless without clarification. Let's unpack them.</p>

          <h3>Agents: What they are (and aren't)</h3>
          <p>In AI, an "agent" is a system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve a goal. But it's not a magical employee.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> An automated workflow that can use tools (like search or a calculator) to complete a task you define.</li>
            <li><strong>What it isn't:</strong> A fully autonomous being that can improvise beyond its programming and goals. Human oversight is critical.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</h3>
          <p>RAG is a technique that helps language models answer questions based on a specific set of documents you provide, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>When it helps:</strong> For building internal knowledge bases, customer support bots, or any application where answers must come from a trusted source.</li>
            <li><strong>When it doesn't:</strong> For purely creative tasks where external knowledge isn't required.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Autonomy: Risks & Approvals</h3>
          <p>True autonomy is the final, most sensitive frontier. It implies a system can operate without human intervention. This requires robust governance.</p>
          <blockquote>
            Checklist: When to say 'no' to full autonomy. Is the task high-risk? Does it involve PII? Can failure cause significant financial or reputational damage? If yes, a human-in-the-loop is non-negotiable.
