## Core Principles

Every ANACHRON image must obey these fundamental rules:

### 1. Anachronism With Intent
Technology must feel **diegetic**—as if it was crafted using ancient materials or logically exists in that world.

**✅ Good:** Bronze-rimmed hologram, mosaic "pixel" display, wax tablet that glows
**❌ Bad:** iPhone sitting on marble, LED billboard, plastic laptop

### 2. Period Fidelity
Wardrobe, poses, and settings must be historically grounded:
- **Clothing:** Togas, chitons, peploi, linen tunics
- **Poses:** Contrapposto (weight on one leg), classical hand gestures
- **Materials:** Marble, stucco, fresco, mosaic, terracotta, bronze
- **Settings:** Mediterranean coastlines, columned architecture, forum spaces
- **Lighting:** Natural academic classicism (golden hour, torchlight, moonlight)

### 3. Unified Material Language
Technology inherits the era's textures—marble dust, patina, gold leaf, mosaic tesserae, carved wood. The environment's natural Mediterranean light falls on ALL objects equally.

### 4. Painterly Finish
Output should evoke:
- 19th-century neoclassical academic painting (David, Ingres, Alma-Tadema)
- Restored fresco with craquelure, flaking pigment, gesso
- Classical sculpture with chips, tool marks, weathering

### 5. Clarity of Story
Each image captures a single clear moment:
- Teaching, debate, discovery, pact, navigation
- Composed in triads and groups
- Gestures and eyelines guide the viewer

### 6. Color Harmony
**Core Palette:**
- **Sky/Sea:** Azure, cerulean, turquoise
- **Drapery:** Terracotta, russet, ivory, cream
- **Architecture:** Warm beige marble, weathered stucco
- **Metals:** Verdigris bronze, gold leaf accents
- **Tech Glow:** Muted cyan, soft gold (no harsh neon)

### 7. Respectful Timelessness
- No parody of culture or deity
- Figures are anonymous archetypes (philosopher, scribe, artisan, oracle, engineer)
- Treat technology as sacred tools, not gadgets
- Maintain dignity and gravitas

---

## Composition Rules

### The Triad System
Classical composition often uses **three primary figures**:
- **Left figure:** Looks or gestures toward center
- **Center figure:** Acts (teaches, demonstrates, operates tech)
- **Right figure:** Reacts (observes, considers, records)

**Triangulate eyelines** around the technology element to guide viewer attention.

### Depth Layers
Build in three zones:
1. **Foreground:** Tactile texture—marble dust, tool marks, fabric weave, close-up tech details
2. **Midground:** Figures in clear interaction, primary narrative action
3. **Background:** Architectural elements, Aegean coastline, bokeh-blurred colonnade

### Gesture Flow
- **Pointing hands** guide viewer's eye to tech
- **Teaching gestures** (open palm, finger counting) convey knowledge transfer
- **Reverent poses** (hands clasped, gentle touch) treat tech as sacred
- **Collaborative gestures** (overlapping hands, shared tools) show teamwork

### Story Clarity
The image should communicate its core action in **1 second**:
- What is happening? (teaching, discovering, consulting, forging)
- Who is involved? (philosopher, artisan, oracle, navigator)
- What is the technology? (glowing tablet, mosaic screen, automaton hand)

Avoid:
- Ambiguous scenes with no clear focal action
- Overcrowded compositions (max 5-6 figures)
- Hidden or obscured technology

---

## Material Mapping

**CRITICAL RULE:** Technology must look like it was made in the ancient world using period materials.

### Surface Unity Techniques

#### For Screens/Displays:
- Base: Polished obsidian (volcanic glass) or black marble
- Frame: Bronze with verdigris patina
- "Pixels": Mosaic tesserae or etched grooves catching light
- Glow: Soft cyan or warm gold, not harsh LED white

#### For Circuits/Wiring:
- Pattern: Greek key meander, acanthus scroll
- Material: Copper or gold leaf, embedded in stone or bronze
- Aging: Verdigris in recesses, wear on high points

#### For Projections/Holograms:
- Render: Translucent painted rays (like fresco divine light)
- Source: Obsidian altar, bronze lens array
- Integration: Cast shadows/reflections on marble surfaces

#### For Automation/Robotics:
- Structure: Bronze skeletal frame
- Joints: Ivory or marble, visible articulation
- Skin: Aged bronze with tool marks, not smooth plastic
- Expression: Sympathetic, lifelike—never cartoonish

### Aging Pass (Apply to ALL Elements)
- **Craquelure:** Fine paint cracks across surfaces
- **Flaked pigment:** Edges where fresco has fallen, revealing plaster
- **Patina:** Green verdigris on bronze, white calcification on marble
- **Weathering:** Smoothed high-touch areas, pitting from salt air
- **Varnish glare:** Subtle sheen suggesting protective coating on paintings
- **Chipped edges:** Missing corners on marble, worn bezel edges
- **Tool marks:** Chisel scars, file lines, hammer dents (hand-worked feel)
- **Kintsugi repairs:** Gold-filled cracks in marble or ceramic

---

## Quality Standards

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

#### ✅ Anatomy & Figures
- **Correct proportions:** No elongated limbs, proper head-to-body ratio
- **Clean hands:** Exactly 5 fingers, clear knuckles, natural poses
- **Aligned eyes:** Symmetrical, looking in coherent direction
- **Realistic skin:** Subtle color variation, not plastic-smooth
- **Period-appropriate bodies:** Athletic but not bodybuilder, natural proportions

#### ✅ Drapery & Fabric
- **Heavy fabric logic:** Gravity-appropriate folds, bunching at waist
- **Material indication:** Linen (crisp, flowing), wool (heavier, structured)
- **Movement:** Billowing in sea breeze, or static in still indoor air
- **Color:** Naturally dyed hues (madder red, woad blue, saffron yellow)

#### ✅ Technology Integration
- **Edge wear:** Tech surfaces show use—scratches, patina, smoothed corners
- **Material consistency:** Tech made from marble/bronze/obsidian, not plastic
- **Lighting coherence:** Tech glow interacts with environment (reflections on faces, marble)
- **Scale logic:** Tech proportions make sense with human interaction

#### ✅ Classical Motifs
- **Decorative elements present but not noisy:**
  - Greek key (meander) borders
  - Acanthus leaf carvings
  - Laurel wreaths
  - Egg-and-dart molding
  - Dentil patterns
- **Used as framing devices or on borders, not overwhelming**

#### ✅ Depth & Atmosphere
- **Foreground detail:** Sharp focus, tactile texture
- **Midground clarity:** Figures crisp, readable gestures
- **Background softness:** Bokeh or atmospheric haze on distant elements
- **Air perspective:** Cooler, lighter tones in distance

#### ✅ Story Readability
- **One-second comprehension:** Clear what is happening
- **Eyeline guidance:** Figures direct viewer to focal point (usually tech)
- **Gesture clarity:** Hands and poses communicate intent
- **Emotional tone:** Respectful, curious, awed—not comedic

#### ✅ Finish & Surface
- **Craquelure visible** (for paintings)
- **Varnish sheen** (subtle glare in light areas)
- **Flaked edges** (for frescoes)
- **Tool marks** (for sculptures)
- **Minimal text:** If any, in Greek characters or abstract symbols

## Model-Specific Settings

### OpenAI DALL-E 3 (Primary Recommendation)
**Best for:** Academic painting finish, complex compositions, proper anatomy

```javascript
{
  model: 'dall-e-3',
  quality: 'hd',
  size: '1024x1792', // 3:4 portrait
  // or '1792x1024' // 16:9 landscape
  style: 'natural' // NOT 'vivid' (oversaturates)
}
```

**Prompting tips:**
- Lead with "neoclassical academic oil painting" or "weathered fresco"
- Emphasize "craquelure, varnish sheen" for aged look
- Specify "high anatomical fidelity, clean hands, five fingers"
- Mention "Mediterranean light" for color tone
- Use "respectful, dignified tone" to avoid parody

---

### Replicate Flux 1.1 Pro (Secondary)
**Best for:** High detail, fine textures, painterly finish control

```javascript
{
  model: 'black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro',
  aspect_ratio: '3:4', // or '16:9', '4:5'
  num_outputs: 1,
  guidance_scale: 3.5, // lower = more painterly, less digital
  num_inference_steps: 40,
  seed: -1 // or fixed for consistency
}
```

**Prompting tips:**
- Use same vocabulary as DALL-E
- Guidance scale 3-4 for painterly, 6-8 for photorealistic sculpture
- Add "oil painting texture, visible brushwork" for canvas feel
- Consider upscaling output for extreme detail

---

### Stable Diffusion XL (Budget Option)
**Best for:** Batch generation, local control, LoRA customization

```
Steps: 40
CFG Scale: 6-8
Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras
Hi-Res Fix: 1.5x upscale
Denoising: 0.5
```

**Recommended LoRAs:**
- Neoclassical painting style
- Craquelure / aged canvas
- Marble sculpture
- Academic realism

**Prompting tips:**
- Front-load most important terms (model attention decays)
- Use emphasis syntax: `(neoclassical:1.3), (craquelure:1.2)`
- Negative embeddings help: `(modern:1.5), (plastic:1.5)`

---

### Midjourney v6+ (Alternative)
**Best for:** Artistic interpretation, dramatic lighting, composition variety

```
Parameters:
--ar 3:4 (or 16:9, 4:5)
--stylize 200 (medium artistic interpretation)
--chaos 8 (slight variation)
--quality 1 (standard)
--style raw (less automatic beautification)
```

**Prompting tips:**
- Keep prompt concise (MJ weights all terms equally)
- Use `::2` weight syntax for emphasis: `neoclassical oil painting::2`
- Add `--seed 12345` to lock composition across variations
- Avoid "neon, cyberpunk" explicitly in prompt

---

## Rapid Design Heuristics

### Quick Composition Checklist
1. **Triads:** Left looks → Center acts → Right reacts
2. **Eyelines:** All figures' gazes triangulate around tech
3. **Depth:** Foreground texture → Midground figures → Background architecture
4. **Light:** Warm (sun/torch) vs Cool (tech glow)
5. **Story:** One clear moment (teaching, discovering, consulting)

### Material Mapping Quick Reference
- **Circuit** = Greek key meander in copper
- **Screen** = Obsidian or mosaic tesserae
- **Hologram** = Translucent painted rays, gold leaf
- **Touch interface** = Polished black stone
- **Speaker** = Bronze amphora with wave patterns
- **Automation** = Bronze-and-ivory articulated hands
- **Data storage** = Rock crystal stacks or scroll racks
- **Network** = Gilded circuit paths between columns

### Aging Quick Pass
- Craquelure on painted surfaces
- Flaked pigment edges
- Verdigris on bronze
- Chipped marble corners
- Tool marks on carved elements
- Kintsugi gold in cracks
- Salt stains on coastal marble
- Worn high-touch areas

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Context Analysis Phase
- Read surrounding page content
- Identify key themes (AI, automation, collaboration, innovation)
- Extract metaphors (navigation, discovery, teaching, strategy)
- Determine image placement and aspect ratio needs

### 2. Blueprint Construction Phase
- Fill out Scene Blueprint Schema (era, subject, tech, lighting, camera)
- Choose ancient-tech metaphor from Translation Guide
- Select triad composition with clear roles
- Plan depth layers (foreground/midground/background)

### 3. Prompt Assembly Phase
- Start with medium ("neoclassical academic oil painting")
- Describe figures (number, poses, drapery, contrapposto)
- Detail tech element (material, integration, glow)
- Specify lighting (golden hour, torchlit, moonlit)
- Add environmental context (coastline, stoa, forum)
- Include aging pass (craquelure, patina, chips)
- State color palette (azure, terracotta, gold)
- End with quality specs (ultra detailed, clean hands, respectful tone)

### 4. Quality Validation Phase
- Check anatomy (hands, eyes, proportions)
- Verify material consistency (no plastic)
- Confirm story clarity (readable action)
- Validate color harmony (no harsh neon)
- Ensure aging signs present (craquelure, patina)

### 5. Generation & Iteration Phase
- Generate with chosen model
- Review against Quality Standards checklist
- Request variations if needed (Alt A, Alt B)
- Refine specific elements while maintaining style consistency

## Integration Best Practices

### For Marketing Pages
- Match image narrative to page content (AI automation → philosophers with mosaic interface)
- Use vertical 3:4 for sidebar features, 16:9 for hero banners
- Maintain consistent lighting across page image set (all golden hour OR all torchlit)
- Place images to break up text without distracting from message

### For Case Studies
- Create specific ancient-tech metaphor for each client industry
- Show collaborative triads for partnership stories
- Use close-ups (waist-up, 4:5) for testimonial sections
- Include detail shots (hands interacting with tech) for process descriptions

### For Blog & Resources
- Header images in 16:9 panoramic for readability
- Abstract detail shots (marble texture, circuit meander) for pull quotes
- Consistent palette across article series
- Mix composition types (group, solo, architectural) for visual variety

## Maintenance & Evolution

### Adding New Metaphors
When discovering new ancient-tech translations:
1. Document material mapping in Translation Guide
2. Create 2-3 example prompts demonstrating usage
3. Add to agent vocabulary in `.claude/agents/anachron-art-director.md`
4. Test across different models for consistency

### Tracking Quality Metrics
Monitor outputs for:
- Anatomy failures (extra fingers, distorted faces) → adjust negative prompts
- Style drift (modern elements creeping in) → strengthen period vocabulary
- Composition repetition → expand camera and framing variety

### Prompt Library Growth
Save successful prompts with metadata:
- Context (which page, what purpose)
- Blueprint used
- Model and settings
- User feedback
- Variations attempted

Store in `generated/anachron/prompt-library.json` for pattern analysis.

**Core Formula:**
```
[Medium] + [Figures in period dress] + [Ancient-tech element] +
[Integration method] + [Lighting] + [Environment] + [Aging pass] +
[Color palette] + [Quality specs]
```

**Essential Vocabulary:**
neoclassical, craquelure, contrapposto, verdigris, obsidian, mosaic tesserae, god-rays, terracotta, Azure Aegean, gold leaf, marble grain, Greek key meander

**Key Negatives:**
neon, plastic, modern clothing, text, extra fingers, distorted face, lowres

**Aspect Ratios:**
- 3:4 (portrait) for sidebar images
- 4:5 (tall portrait) for mobile-first
- 16:9 (landscape) for hero banners
- 1:1 (square) for profile/detail shots

**Lighting Moods:**
- Golden hour = warm, optimistic
- Torchlit = dramatic, focused
- Moonlit = mysterious, contemplative
- Overcast = calm, studious
