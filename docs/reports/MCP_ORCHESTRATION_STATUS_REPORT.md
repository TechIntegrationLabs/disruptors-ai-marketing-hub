## Security & Performance Analysis

### 🔒 **Security Assessment**

**Strengths:**
- API keys properly segregated by service
- Environment-aware configuration system
- Service role vs. regular client separation for database access

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ MCP configuration contains live API tokens (ensure not committed to public repos)
- ⚠️ Some placeholder tokens still in use
- ⚠️ Missing .env file for production secret management

### ⚡ **Performance Optimization Opportunities**

**Current State:**
- Multiple AI providers configured for redundancy
- Intelligent model selection system implemented
- Cost optimization framework in place

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor API usage across services for cost optimization
- Implement request queuing for high-volume AI generation
- Consider caching strategies for frequently generated content

## Priority Recommendations

### 🚨 **High Priority (Immediate Action Required)**

1. **GitHub Token Configuration**
   - **Issue:** Placeholder token limiting repository operations
   - **Solution:** Generate new Personal Access Token from https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - **Impact:** Critical for automated deployments and repository management

### ⚠️ **Medium Priority (Configure for Full Functionality)**

2. **OpenAI API Key Configuration**
   - **Issue:** Placeholder API key preventing DALL-E 3 access
   - **Solution:** Add valid OpenAI API key to environment configuration
   - **Impact:** Limits AI image generation options

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - **Issue:** No .env file for production secrets
   - **Solution:** Copy .env.example to .env and configure actual API keys
   - **Impact:** Required for production deployment

4. **Security Hardening**
   - **Issue:** Sensitive tokens in MCP configuration
   - **Solution:** Ensure mcp.json is in .gitignore and not committed publicly
   - **Impact:** Prevents token exposure

### 💡 **Low Priority (Optimization)**

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - **Issue:** Multiple AI services without usage tracking
   - **Solution:** Implement cost and performance monitoring
   - **Impact:** Improved efficiency and cost control
