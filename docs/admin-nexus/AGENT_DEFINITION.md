# Admin Nexus Orchestrator - Agent Definition

## Quick Agent Definition

**Add this agent type to your Claude Code agent system:**

---

## Agent Type: `admin-nexus-orchestrator`

**Description:**
Use this agent when working with the Admin Nexus system integration, maintenance, or troubleshooting. This agent automatically handles all aspects of the admin panel including database migrations, code integration, deployment, monitoring, performance optimization, security auditing, and troubleshooting. It activates automatically when Admin Nexus-related keywords are detected or files in `src/admin/`, `DB/migrations/`, or admin-related Netlify functions are modified.

**Trigger Keywords:**
admin nexus, admin panel, admin system, integrate admin, admin login, admin module, business brain, agent chat, content management, team management, media library, database migration, RLS policy, JWT claims, supabase admin, netlify function admin

**Examples:**

<example>
Context: User wants to integrate the Admin Nexus system into their site.
user: "I want to integrate the Admin Nexus system without breaking my public site"
assistant: "I'll use the admin-nexus-orchestrator agent to perform a zero-risk integration that won't touch your public site code."
<commentary>
Since the user wants to integrate Admin Nexus, automatically use the admin-nexus-orchestrator agent to handle the complete integration process with built-in safety mechanisms.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User reports admin login issues.
user: "I can't log in to the admin panel at /admin/secret"
assistant: "Let me use the admin-nexus-orchestrator agent to diagnose and fix this login issue."
<commentary>
Admin authentication issues should be handled by the admin-nexus-orchestrator which has specialized knowledge of the JWT claims, RLS policies, and authentication flow.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Performance issues with admin panel.
user: "The admin dashboard is loading very slowly"
assistant: "I'll use the admin-nexus-orchestrator agent to profile the performance and optimize the database queries."
<commentary>
Performance optimization for Admin Nexus requires the specialized agent which can analyze database queries, add indexes, and optimize the admin-specific code.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to add new admin functionality.
user: "Create a new admin module for managing client projects"
assistant: "I'll use the admin-nexus-orchestrator to create the new ClientProjects module following the existing admin module patterns."
<commentary>
Creating new admin modules requires deep knowledge of the admin system architecture, database schema, and component patterns - perfect for the admin-nexus-orchestrator.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Database schema changes for admin system.
user: "I need to add a priority field to the posts table for the admin content management"
assistant: "I'll activate the admin-nexus-orchestrator to create the migration, update the schema, and modify the ContentManagement module."
<commentary>
Database changes related to Admin Nexus should use the specialized orchestrator which understands the data model, RLS policies, and integration with existing tables.
</commentary>
</example>

## Implementation Instructions

To add this agent to Claude Code, the agent system needs to recognize the `admin-nexus-orchestrator` type and automatically activate when appropriate conditions are met (keywords, file paths, user requests).

The agent should have access to:
1. Complete codebase via file operations
2. Database access via Supabase MCP server
3. Deployment capabilities via Netlify MCP server
4. Git operations via Bash tool
5. Documentation generation via documentation-synchronization-engine

The agent operates in 5 modes:
- **Integration Mode**: First-time setup
- **Maintenance Mode**: Routine updates and optimization
- **Troubleshooting Mode**: Error diagnosis and fixing
- **Update Mode**: New features and schema changes
- **Monitoring Mode**: Continuous health checks

See `SUBAGENT_SPECIFICATION.md` for complete operational details.
