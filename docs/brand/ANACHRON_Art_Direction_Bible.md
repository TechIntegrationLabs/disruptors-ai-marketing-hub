# ANACHRON — Art Direction Bible

## Purpose
Define the visual language for creating images that depict **ancient Greco‑Roman scenes** with **modern/futuristic technology** integrated **diegetically**. For use by a Custom GPT, other image models, and human artists.

## Core Concept (one sentence)
**Respectful academic antiquity fused with believable, era‑material technology; painterly, solemn, and story‑driven.**

## North‑Star Principles
1. **Diegetic tech** using ancient materials and craft (marble, bronze/verdigris, gold leaf, mosaic tesserae, carved wood, obsidian/rock crystal).
2. **Period fidelity** in garments, architecture, and gestures (contrapposto, laurel, frieze logic, coastal settings).
3. **Painterly finish** — academic oil or weathered fresco; craquelure, flaked pigment, varnish sheen; sculpture shows chisel/tool marks.
4. **Cohesive light** — Mediterranean sun, torch, or moon; tech glow is subtle and interacts with surfaces.
5. **Unified palette** — ivory/terracotta/azure/bronze/verdigris with gold‑leaf accents.
6. **Clear story** — debate, teaching, pact, navigation, discovery; triads; guided eyelines.
7. **Respectful timelessness** — anonymous archetypes; no celebrity likeness; no parody.

## Visual Vocabulary
- **Materials & surfaces:** marble veins, chips, kintsugi seams; bronze with verdigris; gold leaf; stucco; fresco plaster; mosaic tesserae; carved oak/olive; rock crystal/obsidian.
- **Ancient→Tech mapping:** meander=circuit; mosaic=pixel HUD; obsidian mirror=OLED; wax tablet=tablet; astrolabe=hologram; amphora=speaker; frieze relief=UI; laurel diadem=circuit crown.
- **Composition heuristics:** triads; foreground anchor → midground actors → background sea/architecture; clear gesture flow; horizon choice sets mood.
- **Palette accents:** azure/teal, terracotta/russet, ivory, gold leaf, verdigris.

## Scene Blueprint Schema
- **era_setting:** Greek coastal terrace | stoa interior | Roman forum | library of Alexandria | marble workshop | temple steps | roofless observatory  
- **subject_action:** philosophers debating | scribe teaching pupils | artisan forging | oracle consulting | sailors navigating | council planning | priesthood ritual  
- **tech_motif:** mosaic HUD | bronze automaton hand | obsidian tablet | holographic astrolabe | amphora speaker | marble viewport | basalt touch wall  
- **integration_method:** carved into frieze | inset in broken wall | set in bronze bezel | painted as fresco restoration | embedded in sculpture | mounted on stone plinth  
- **lighting_time:** golden hour side light | dappled colonnade | overcast diffuse | torchlit nocturne | moonlit marble  
- **camera:** three‑quarter group | low‑angle heroic | intimate waist‑up | architectural long shot  
- **medium_finish:** academic oil on canvas with craquelure | weathered fresco | marble sculpture with chips and patina  
- **palette_accents:** azure | terracotta | ivory | gold leaf | verdigris  
- **quality_flags:** correct anatomy | clean hands | cohesive light | micro‑wear on tech | legible faces  
- **negatives_default:** neon, cyberpunk, plastic, modern logos, cars, skyscrapers, graffiti text, watermark, deformed hands, extra fingers, distorted face, lowres, oversaturated  
- **aspect_ratio:** 3:4 | 4:5 | 16:9 | 1:1

## Model Settings
- **Midjourney v6+** — `--ar 3:4 --style raw --stylize 200 --chaos 8 --quality 1` (sculpture close‑ups `--ar 1:1`).
- **SDXL** — steps 30–50, CFG 5–8, hi‑res fix 1.5–2×; sampler DPM++ 2M Karras; strong negatives for text/hands/neon.
- **DALL·E/GPT‑image** — emphasize medium and materials; provide two alternates.

## Output Contract
1. Logline  
2. Final Image Prompt  
3. Alt A / Alt B (optional)  
4. Negative Prompt  
5. Render Controls

## Quality Checklist
- Anatomy/hands correct; faces undistorted.  
- Drapery weight coherent.  
- Tech materiality matches environment; micro‑wear and shared reflections.  
- Clear story beat; readable in one second.  
- Painterly finish (craquelure/fresco or chisel/tool marks).  
- Balanced palette; gold‑leaf accents at focal points.  
- **Ban** modern logos/plastics/cars/skyscrapers/neon.

## Negative Bank
neon, cyberpunk, plastic, modern logos, contemporary streetwear, cars, skyscrapers/city skyline, text/watermark, deformed hands, extra fingers, mutated limbs, distorted faces, oversaturated, flat lighting, cartoon/anime.

## Troubleshooting
- Looks too modern → emphasize ancient materials/finish; add “no plastic/logos/neon” in negatives.  
- Anatomy issues → add “correct anatomy, clean hands”; raise quality/steps.  
- Tech feels pasted → add micro‑wear and light interaction; cast glow on nearby surfaces.  
- Color too synthetic → bias to azure/terracotta/ivory/verdigris; reduce saturation.

## Few‑Shot Exemplars
- Philosophers & Slate; Tablet Lesson; Pact; Oracle Mirror; Bust Viewport; Seaside Planners; Astrolabe Navigators; Muses Data Scroll; Shield Circuits; Relief Symposium Hologram; Crystal Servers; Amphora Speakers; Night Code Inscription; Circuit Crown; Harbor Mosaic Map; Automaton Scribe; Basalt Touch Wall; First Ping Ritual; Hologram Theater; Oracle’s Workshop.

## Compliance
Be respectful of antiquity/culture; avoid real brand marks or named deities unless explicitly requested with care.
