## 🚨 Critical Issue Identified

### Database Configuration Issue ❌
**Problem**: The application is attempting to connect to `localhost:54321` instead of the production Supabase instance.

**Impact**:
- Admin session creation falls back to sessionStorage
- Media generation may not persist to database
- Analytics and usage tracking not functioning

**Solution**: Update environment variables to use production Supabase URL:
- Current: `http://127.0.0.1:54321`
- Should be: `https://ubqxflzuvxowigbjmqfb.supabase.co`

**Severity**: Medium - Core functionality works but data persistence is limited
