- ⚠️ Don't commit credentials to git
- ⚠️ Keep service role key secret
- ⚠️ Review RLS policies before production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't Log In?
1. Check credentials: admin@disruptors.co / Admin123!Nexus
2. Verify user exists in Supabase Auth dashboard
3. Check JWT claims include role='admin'
4. See: docs/admin-nexus/TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### Module Won't Load?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database tables exist
3. Check RLS policies allow access
4. See: docs/admin-nexus/TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### Public Site Broken?
1. Check App.jsx admin guard (lines 5-7)
2. Verify no other files modified
3. Check build for errors
4. Rollback: `git checkout aa0890f`
